There is an additional requirement that clients should be able to access certain areas of the system relevant to them.
 
The business believes it can reduce admin overhead by 50% in moving away from a manual process.  
The team is located across offices and currently uses Outlook calendar reminders to trigger specific tasks and actions that need to take place. 
All arising documentation will continue to be stored in the firm's document management system.
 
At the end of 10 weeks, the first client will come on board. They will be able to view the status of their cases and to upload documents. 
Some of these documents will be of a highly sensitive nature. Although the technical resource has been approved for the duration of the project, 
the resource for the user testing hasn't been finalised due to a very heavy client workload in the legal team. This doesn't bode well for the pilot phase.
 
Additionally with GDPR considerations high on the agenda, it has also been identified that a PIA (Privacy Impact Statement) will need to be conducted 
due to the sensitive nature of the data being handled. Any necessary actions will need to be factored into the project plan, this could give rise to additional 
technical resource needs.
 
The IT Trainer is scheduled to draft training guides for both the team and their clients and will deliver a training session but ultimately the users at 
OC need to be comfortable with the new process prior to the on-boarding of any clients.
 
All clients (of which there are 20) will eventually need to access their respective areas of the system and there is a list that prioritises the order.
